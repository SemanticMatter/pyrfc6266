[Full Changelog](https://github.com/SemanticMatter/pyrfc6266/compare/v1001.0.2...HEAD)

# First release

This marks the first release of `pyrfc6266` to SINTEF's GitLab PyPI.

We're upping the Epoch number, specifying the following versioning scheme: `( EPOCH * 1000 + MAJOR ).MINOR.PATCH`.
As there has been no other additions, we simply up the Epoch and keep all other version numbers the same as the [official pyrfc6266 package](https://pypi.org/project/pyrfc6266).

The repository has been updated to match other SemanticMatter projects in terms of development tools, etc.

The main reason behind forking the original pyrfc6266 project from @JohnDoee, was to be able to update the dependencies, since it was locked quite hard - which is fair.
Indeed, we do not intend to optimize the package further, other than changes that result in security risks or come from upstream.
